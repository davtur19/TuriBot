## Requirements
### Stable
PHP 7.1 or higher with curl extension
### Beta (Async)
PHP 8.1 or higher, you need to install amp from composer

## Installation

### Stable
```sh
composer require davtur19/turibot 1.x
```

### Beta (Async)
```sh
composer init --name=your.name/yourbot --no-interaction
composer config minimum-stability dev
composer require davtur19/turibot 2.x
```

### Webhook
Setup recommended: open [setupWebhook.php](https://github.com/davtur19/TuriBot/blob/master/examples/setupWebhook.php) in your browser and follow the setup wizard.

Manual setup: set webhook to the file [webhook.php](https://github.com/davtur19/TuriBot/blob/master/examples/webhook.php), and as parameter GET "api" set your token.

Example for manual setup:
```sh
curl https://api.telegram.org/botTOKEN/setWebhook?url=https://WEBSITE/DIR/webhook.php?api=TOKEN
```
Alternatively if you don't want to use GET, just change [this piece of code](https://github.com/davtur19/TuriBot/blob/master/examples/webhook.php#L8-L12).

### GetUpdates
[Setup Token](https://github.com/davtur19/TuriBot/blob/master/examples/getUpdates.php#L8)

## Usage
- Look at the examples ([webhook.php](https://github.com/davtur19/TuriBot/blob/master/examples/webhook.php) and [getUpdates.php](https://github.com/davtur19/TuriBot/blob/master/examples/getUpdates.php)), it's very simple if you know PHP and OOP
- All methods have the parameters in the same order as the [BotAPIs](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#available-methods)
- The `reply_markup`, `permissions`, `commands`, `entities` and parameters that require arrays, already have a json_encode in the functions, you just need to pass arrays

## Custom endpoint
With the Bot API 5.0 it is now possible to [self host your own Bot API](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#using-a-local-bot-api-server), here is an example of how to add your own endpoint
```php
//token, json_payload, endpoint
$client = new Client("1234:AAbbccdd", false, "http://endpoint/bot");
```

## Json payload
Only works with webhooks, for more info: https://core.telegram.org/bots/faq#how-can-i-make-requests-in-response-to-updates

I do not recommend using it as it may need a particular configuration to the webserver for flushing and you cannot get a response from the Bot API

## Old version
I don't recommend its use, but it could be useful for those unfamiliar with OOP and would like to start learning how PHP and Telegram Bot Api work.
